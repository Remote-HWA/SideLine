# Tutorial: Building SideLine (AES) on *******

## Experimental Setup / Software Version

**Board**: *******  
**Processor**: *******  
**Design suite**: *******  
**SDK**: *******  

<!---## Prelude: Vivado

If you already have a working Hardware Platform Specification File for your board, you can skip this step and import it directly in the SDK.
For those who don't have this file, Vivado allows us to create and customize it. 

**1) Create New Vivado Project**
  - Start Vivado
  - Select "Create Project" 
  - Do not add constraint or source files
  - Select your board part (here Zybo). *If the board file does not appear in your vivado version, download it and [**add it**](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/software/vivado/board-files?redirect=1)*
  
**2) Create a simple block design**
  - Click on "Create Block Design" and name it "SideLine"
  - In the "Diagram" window, click on "+" to add an IP
  - Add "Zynq7 processing system" block
  - Click on "Run block automation"
  - Make sure that the "Apply Board Preset" is checked then press "OK"
  - (optional) Modify UART1 baud rate to 921600 bauds (increases attack speed)
  - Connect "M_AXI_GP0_ACLK" to "FCLK_CLK0"
  - In the "Sources" menu, right click on the block design and select "Create HDL Wrapper"
  
**3) Generate Bitstream**
 - Click on "Generate block design" located in the flow navigator
 - if successful select "Generate Bitstream" located in the flow navigator 

**4) Export HW**
- File -> Export -> Export HW (check include bitstream)
- File -> Launch SDK)
-->

## ******* SDK

**1) Verify that the HW platform project exists in the project explorer** (if not add it)

**2) Create the attack project**
  - File -> New -> Application Project
  - Project Name -> CPU0_attack_project
  - Processor CPU0 -> ps7_cortexa9_0
  - Click Next 
  - Select "Empty Application"
  - Click Finish

**3) Create the victim project**
  - File -> New -> Application Project
  - Project Name -> CPU1_victim_project
  - Processor CPU0 -> ps7_cortexa9_1
  - Click Next 
  - Select "Empty Application"
  - Click Finish

You should have 5 projects

**4) Import GIT Source Code (CPU0_attack_project)**
  - First, delete the existing "src" folder in the CPU0_attack_project arborescence
  - Then, drag and drop git folders  [**src**](https://github.com/Remote-HWA/SideLine/tree/master/attack_setup/AES_setup/CPU0_attack/src) and [**inc**](https://github.com/Remote-HWA/SideLine/tree/master/attack_setup/AES_setup/CPU0_attack/inc) into CPU0_attack_project (copy files and folders)  
 Project arborescence should look like that:

 - We need to add "inc" folder in the project include directories:
 - Right click on CPU0_attack_project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols -> Add -> Workspace -> CPU0_attack_project/inc
 - Now all the errors should have disapeared
 
 **5) Import GIT Source Code (CPU0_victim_project)**
  - Reproduce step 4) with the CPU0_victim_project

**6) Run Configuration**

- Connect your board in JTAG mode (PROG UART)
- Open an uart terminal (e.g. teraterm) to test the program
- Select the appropriate COM port & baud rate (115200 default or 921600 in performance mode)
- When the terminal is ready, right click CPU0_attack_project -> Run as -> Launch on hardware (System Debugger)
- Press enter in the terminal, you should see:

**7) Dual Core Configuration**

To set up the attack we need to modify the run configuration. 

- Select RUN -> Run Configurations... -> Select the saved configuration
- Select application window -> Check ps7_cortexa9_1 -> press Apply

Now victim and attack programs shouldn parralel in differents CPU cores.
- To verify, select Run
This time, CPU#0 and CPU#1 messages should appear in the console.

The attack is ready.


# Program User Manual 

### Command table
| cmd | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| aes | <sample_min> <sample_max> <n_Trace> | Start AES SCA acquisition using DLL |
| dll | <n_Sample> | Print current DLL value in decimal |
  
# Save the serial output and use it for SCA

- Once the attack program is up and working, save the serial log using logging in Putty or "File->log..." in teraterm. 
- Then start the AES SCA acquisition using the command AES -> ex: aes 0 100 100000
- Once the acquisition has finished, use the python script available in [**AES_results**](https://github.com/Remote-HWA/SideLine/tree/master/attack_results/AES_results) to parse the file and conduct the CPA. Follow the guideline given in the README file associated to the script.
