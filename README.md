# SideLine - Abstract

This repository provides all the program codes and tutorials necessary to easily reproduce the attacks conducted in SideLine.

# Side-channel attacks based on SoC delay-lines 

SideLine is a novel side-channel vector based on delay-line components widely implemented in high-end SoCs. In the associated paper [paper ref], we provide a detailed method on how to access and convert delay-line data into power consumption information and we demonstrate that these entities can be used to perform remote power side-channel attacks. We report experiments carried out on two SoCs from distinct vendors and we recount several core-vs-core attack scenarios in which an adversary process located in one processor core aims at eavesdropping the activity of a victim process located in another core. For each scenario, we demonstrate the adversary ability to fully recover the secret key of an OpenSSL AES running in the victim core. Even more detrimental, we show that these attacks are still practicable if the victim or the attacker program runs over an operating system.

# What's inside this repository ?

This repository provides a detailed tutorial on how to conduct SideLine DLL attack scenario (a). The attack is conducted on a Xilinx Zynq7010 SoC in baremetal mode. Two C programs (attacker and victim) are implemented in two different physical cores (AP#0 and AP#1). 
We provide all the source code in the folder [**attack_setup**](https://github.com/Remote-HWA/SideLine/tree/master/attack_setup) associated to a detailed README helper file. The attack proposed in the paper was conducted on a Zybo board but should be easily portable on others devices that use Zynq-70xx family. Vivado and Xilinx SDK (Vitis) working installations are required to reproduce the attack.
Several numpy arrays which contain 20M separated traces and their associated plaintexts are provided in the folder [**attack_results**](https://github.com/Remote-HWA/SideLine/tree/master/attack_results). Filtered data arrays are also given, they provide better CPA results with a reduced noise. 
The SCA model leveraged in the paper is close to the first round sbox model but leverages the special t-table output used in OpenSSL AES. The following repository provides a working ttable version of the CPA program https://github.com/cryptolu/aes-cpa.
